 TabTransformer: Tabular Data Modeling 
     Using Contextual Embeddings

This project is inteded to review and analyze following article:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06678.pdf

where novel TabTransformer architecture is presented in order to 
deal with learning task on tabular data.

Run Instructions
First directory 'EasyTabt' contains a minimal code
to try out TabTransformer (running time < 5 min),
while 'MovieLens' contains a whole pipeline to test
TabTransformer on MovieLens dataset, following papers
steps only for supervised learning.
Since training time of 'MovieLens' scripts is about 2
weeks (using UNIBO gpu), and data downloaded/produced
by the pipeline is more than 20 MB (max dimension allowed
to submit project on Virtuale), only scripts are
included but at the following link is possible to find
material generated by the pipeline:

To run 'EasyTabt' demo, first run easy_tabt.py
to generate both TabTransfromer and GBDT roc curves
and also TabTransformer learned embedding. In 'runs' folder
you can observe tabt transformer training loss
decreasing correctly and in 'plots' roc curves are saved.
Optionally run embedding_visualization.py to generate data
exploited by Tensorboard embedding projector, in order to 
visualize embeddings before and after passing through transformer
layers.

To run 'MovieLens' demo, run tab_transformer_demo.py and
the whole pipeline will start.
